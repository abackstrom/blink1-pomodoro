Install and Run
---------------
You'll need to change the blink_path variable in the .sh files to your path.

Then cd to where you saved the .sh file(s) and

```
chmod u+x tomatoes.sh
./tomatoes.sh
```

Tomatoes
--------
tomatoes.sh is a timer where pomodoros start on the hour and half hour. This allows you to align your tomato timer with others, in the spirit of http://tomatoestogether.com/

Pomodoro
--------
The pomodoro.sh begins the pomodoro when you run the script. There are variables that control the length of pomodoros and breaks, so you can alter these if you want.

To Do
-----
tomatoes.sh: have it blink a few times at the beginning of each tomato and break
