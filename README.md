Blink(1) Pomodoro
=================
This is a script for the [blink(1)](http://thingm.com/products/blink-1/), a USB LED. You can use this script with your blink(1) to help you follow the [pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/).

Install and Run
---------------
Change the blink_path variable in the .sh files to your path.

Then cd to where you saved the .sh file(s) and

```
chmod u+x tomatoes.sh
./tomatoes.sh
```

Tomatoes
--------
tomatoes.sh is a timer where pomodoros start on the hour and half hour. This allows you to align your tomato timer with others, in the spirit of http://tomatoestogether.com/

Pomodoro
--------
The pomodoro.sh begins the pomodoro when you run the script. There are variables that control the length of pomodoros and breaks, so you can alter these if you want.
